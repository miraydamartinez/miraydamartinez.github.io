                                    <p> My first visit to San Francisco was like a religious experience. With such a creative and welcoming atmosphere, it is impossible to not feel at home! 
                                </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Every year, the Center for Innovation and Leadership (CIL) selects ten students to attend an all-expense paid, week-long trip to San Francisco preceding the start of the spring semester. This trip is a high-tech adventure that provides students with the opportunity to meet with entrepreneurial alumni who live and work in the Silicon Valley region, to learn about their work and their workplaces, and engage with start-up, Venture Capital, and tech communities. Fortunately, I was one of the ten students selected to participate this year. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                We tried to stay close to the companies we would be visiting, so we spent the first two days in Mountain View. Upon our arrival to the hotel, we settled into our rooms and then met up in the lobby to discuss day-to-day logistics and do introductions. We broke for a quick pair exercise where we talked about why we applied for this opportunity, what we hoped to get out of it, and our goals/aspirations.
                                </p> 
                                <p> I wanted the opportunity to network and experience all that San Francisco had to offer. I also wanted to gain knowledge from alumni, primarily women of color, to hear about their journeys and possibly any advice they have to offer. I wanted to take this knowledge with me to provide helpful guidance for other women of color on campus. Coming to this trip, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was interested in a variety of positions within the tech community. For one, I have always been fascinated by research, learning about ways in which to improve modern technology to better address the needs in a community. However, I have also enjoyed building and enhancing the tools required for development.
                                </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-md-7">
                                            <p> Although I did not get to experience ALL of San Francisco as I had hoped, I did gain a significant amount of knowledge and perspective on the different types of careers in tech. On the first two days of our visit, we toured Google and the Stanford Design School. At Google, we were joined by about ten other alumni, five of which were there in person and the others via skype. It was great networking with all of them, learning about how Swarthmore had helped prepare them for their careers, and hearing their advice for navigating Swarthmore's rigourous academics. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            By contrast, we only had one host at the Stanford Design School, Leticia Cavagnaro. This was by far one of my favorite companies; I enjoyed touring the school and learning about its mission as well as how Leticia came to join the team. During our visit, we had the opportunity to participate in a design thinking workshop.

                                            We were tasked with brainstorming ideas in which we could increase visibility of the innovation space on campus. It was a great way for us to put our skills to work and collaborate with one another on ways to do this. It was even better that after brainstorming a couple of different ideas, we were thrown a constraint and made to re-evaluate our current responses. One such constaint, for example, was an idea that would stir trouble on campus with the administration.  It was such a fun and intellectual experience and I hope to continue using the skills obtained to flesh out more ideas for potential projects in the future.

                                            <p> On the morning of the third day, we ate our breakfast and then traveled to our new hotel in San Francisco, where we would be visiting the remaining five companies. I enjoyed our visit to DFJ and the passion Chirag, our host, had as well as our visit to Ancestry, Open Table, and Stitchfix. However, none beat the feeling I got walking into Title Nine, a clothing and performance apparel company. Named after the federal civil rights law that requires gender equality in all aspects of publicly-funded education, this company fueled my determination and encouraged me to move forward on my academic path. It seems rather difficult to succeed in an environment where men dominate class discussions; where you are the only woman in a computer science lab section of 20 students. Hearing Missy talk about her experiences made me realize I had been so afraid to speak up more and to pursue more opportunities because I always believed men would come first. She showed me otherwise and for that, I am grateful.

                                        <p> In addition to hearing the wonderful stories all the alumni had to share, I made unforgettable memories with a group of incredibly gifted and bright individuals. We got to visit the Golden Gate Bridge and take tourist-y pictures, hike up Twin Peaks on a foggy night where we became so confident we would die, watch sea lions fight with one another at Pier 39, and bond over our favorite shows (yes, Game of Thrones did come up).
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Thanks to this trip, and the amazing individuals behind it, I had come out knowing more than just what career I wanted to pursue, the type of workplace I wanted to be in, and what impact I wanted to make. I came out of this trip with more friends and connections than I could have ever asked for. I cannot wait to come back soon!
