                                    <p> My first visit to San Francisco felt like it was out of a movie. Filled with excitement, curiosity, friendships, and even fear, it is an experience I will never forget.
                                </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Before I get into my story though, I should explain what CIL@SF is. The Center for Innovation and Leadership at San Francisco (CIL@SF) is a high-tech adventure that provides students with the opportunity to meet with entrepreneurial alumni who live and work in the Silicon Valley region, to learn about their and their workplaces, and engage with start-up, Venture Capital, and tech communities. Every year, the Center for Innovation and Leadership (CIL) selects ten students to attend this all-expense paid, week-long trip preceding the start of the spring semester.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Since we were all traveling from different locations, we decided to meet at the San Francisco International Airport and travel to our hotel all together from there. I did not know everyone on the trip. In fact, I only knew two of the people there. However, I did not let that deter me from breaking the ice and asking how everyone’s break had been. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                We tried to stay close to the companies we would be visiting, so we spent the first two days in Mountain View. Upon our arrival to the hotel on the first day we settled into our rooms and met up in the lobby to discuss day-to-day logistics and do introductions. We broke for a quick pair exercise where we talked about why we applied for this opportunity, what we hoped to get out of it, and our goals/aspirations. We had our partner write down our responses to the above questions in our journal for us to reflect on after the trip. When asked what I wanted from this experience, I said:
                                </p>
                                    <blockquote> “ I want to network and experience all that San Francisco has to offer. I also want to gain knowledge from alumni, primarily women of color, to hear about their journeys and possibly any advice they have to offer.  ”</blockquote>

                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-md-7">
                                            <p> Although I did not get to experience ALL of San Francisco as I had hoped, I did gain a significant amount of knowledge and perspective on the different types of careers in tech. On the first two days of our visit, we toured Google and the Stanford Design School. At Google, we were joined by about ten other alumni, five of which were there in person and the remaining were there via video chat. It was great learning about all their different roles and career paths. Fast forward to the Stanford Design School; one of my favorite companies. I very much enjoyed touring the school and participating in the design thinking workshop at the D.School. It was a great way for us to put our skills to work and collaborate with one another on ways to solve a given problem. It was even better that after solving one, we were thrown a constraint and made to re-evaluate our solution. The exercise left such a great impression on me. I hope to continue using the skills obtained to flesh out ideas for potential projects in the future.

                                            <p> On the morning of the third day, we ate our breakfast and then traveled to our new hotel in San Francisco, where we would be visiting our remaining five companies. I enjoyed our visit to DFJ and the passion Chirag, our host, had as well as our visit to Ancestry, Open Table, and Stitchfix. However, none beat the feeling I got walking into Title Nine, a clothing and performance apparel company. Named after the federal civil rights law that requires gender equality in all aspects of publicly-funded education, this company fueled my determination and encouraged me to move forward on my academic path. It seems rather difficult to succeed in an environment where men dominate class discussions; where you are the only woman in computer science lab section of 20 students. Hearing Missy talk about her experiences made me realize I had been so afraid to speak up more and to pursue more opportunities because I always believed men would come first. She showed me otherwise and for that, I am grateful.

                                        <p> In addition to hearing the wonderful stories all the alumni had to share, I made unforgettable memories with a group of incredibly gifted and bright individuals. We got to visit the Golden Gate Bridge and take tourist-y pictures, hike up Twin Peaks where we became so confident we would die, and bond over our favorite shows (yes, Game of Thrones did come up).
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Thanks to this trip, and the amazing individuals behind it, I had come out knowing more than just what career I wanted to pursue, the type of workplace I wanted to be in, and what impact I wanted to make. I came out of this trip with more friends and connections than I could have ever asked for.
